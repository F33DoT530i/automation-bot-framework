# Usage Guidelines and Best Practices

## Ethical Guidelines for Screen Recording and Process Logging

### Before You Start Recording

1. **Obtain Consent**: Always get explicit permission before recording
2. **Inform Participants**: Clearly communicate what will be recorded
3. **Document Purpose**: Have a legitimate business or personal reason
4. **Review Laws**: Understand applicable laws in your jurisdiction

### During Recording

1. **Minimize Exposure**: Only record what is necessary
2. **Avoid Sensitive Data**: Be cautious with passwords, credentials, and personal information
3. **Monitor Scope**: Stay within the boundaries of your authorization
4. **Respect Privacy**: Do not record private conversations or sensitive areas

### After Recording

1. **Secure Storage**: Encrypt and protect recorded data
2. **Limited Retention**: Delete recordings when no longer needed
3. **Access Control**: Restrict who can view recordings
4. **Compliance**: Ensure proper handling according to regulations

### Legitimate Use Cases

✓ Personal productivity tracking (with self-consent)
✓ Authorized software testing and QA
✓ Educational demonstrations (with proper consent)
✓ Bug reproduction for technical support
✓ Authorized workplace monitoring (with employee consent and policy compliance)
✓ Personal device automation for self-improvement

### Unacceptable Use Cases

✗ Spying on others without consent
✗ Recording confidential meetings without authorization
✗ Capturing proprietary information for unauthorized purposes
✗ Monitoring employees without proper disclosure and consent
✗ Any form of stalking or harassment
✗ Circumventing security for malicious purposes

### Legal Considerations by Jurisdiction

#### United States
- Federal wiretapping laws may apply

- Workplace monitoring must comply with federal and state laws

#### European Union
- GDPR compliance required for personal data
- Explicit consent requirements
- Right to be forgotten and data portability

#### Other Jurisdictions
- Research and comply with local laws before use
- When in doubt, consult legal counsel

### Best Practices

1. **Transparency**: Be open about what you're recording and why
2. **Minimal Data**: Record only what you need
3. **Security First**: Protect recordings like you would protect passwords
4. **Regular Audits**: Review your use periodically
5. **Documentation**: Keep records of consent and purpose

### When in Doubt

If you're unsure whether your intended use is appropriate:
- Consult with a legal professional
- Review your organization's policies
- Consider the ethical implications
- Choose not to record

### Remember

**The responsibility for lawful and ethical use rests entirely with you, the user.**
